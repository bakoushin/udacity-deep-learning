## Bike Rental Patterns (MLP)

[Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/bakoushin/udacity-deep-learning/bike-rental-patterns/bike_rental_patterns.ipynb)

Very basic multi-layer perceptron which is trained on a [bike-sharing company dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset) in order to predict trends in daily bike rental ridership.

Got good results on predicting daily rental patterns.
